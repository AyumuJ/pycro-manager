Data acquisition with ``pycromanager.acquire``
******************************************************

The ``Acquisition`` class in ``pycromanager.acquire`` is a powerful abstraction for acquiring data across an abitrary number of axes (e.g. timelapses, multiple channels, Z-stacks), on-the-fly modification of acquisition control, and processing and modifying acquired data in real time. ``pycromanager.data`` provides the capabilities to read the acquired data as ``numpy`` or ``dask`` arrays for image analysis at scales anywhere from a laptop to a cluster.
