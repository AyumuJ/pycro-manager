This page will show full/advanced examples of using ``pycro-manager`` interesting applications.

If you have an application you'd like to figure out how to enable, please reach out!

Potential applications to add
- specifying acquisition based on feedback from images
- Tiled XY acquisitions that make use of multi-resolution
- snap an image within the acquisition cycle (eg autofocus)
- Cross correlation volume-based autofocus?
- Use magellan for slide scanning. Pause acq and do further stuff on interesting cells
- Adaptive illumination using magellan surfaces
